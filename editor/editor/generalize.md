# Parts needed to generalize

What we really want to implement here is GetSet<int>

- st/frontend/lib/main.dart
  - includes int_route.dart and int_view.dart via view.dart
  - defines main, which calls runApp on MyApp
  - defines MyApp as just a generic StatelessWidget 
    - overrides build
    - build instantiates MaterialApp passing intRoute home page
    - intRoute in turn knows about and uses intView



- frontend/lib/int/ViewProxy_int.dart
  - defines GUI proxy for the type, int
  - requires OpenAPI schema to generate serialized rep of int
  - contains instance of class generated by OpenAPI from that schema
  - generated file is in frontend/packages/int/lib/src/model/int.dart
  - has instance of bloc hand-crafted to implement get/set interface
  - has constructors all take an int bloc as an argument
  - implements get/set interface, where set takes an int
  - this interface just delegates to the bloc
