    We've been talking about using this project for is to test out Daniel Jackson's notion 
    of "concepts," understood as polymorphic independent computational building blocks of 
    user-facing software designs. Jackson proposes that one structure systems as compositions 
    of such concepts under various composition mechanisms. One of the nice things about 
    admitting a concept into the discussion is that we can then hang new concepts off of it.
    
    Take "institution." That concept gives us a place to hang what I'd suggest as a concept of 
    "institutional preconditions for successful deployment of 'our "approach'." On this frame 
    we can then hang the idea that there are both technical and social preconditions for the
    successful operation of a system like ours. Technical preconditions include, for example, 
    provision of a standard local authentication and identity service. A social precondition
    might be that an institution has a policy and culture of non-retaliation against good
    faith reporters. From there we could think about 'certifying' that institutions satisfy
    the preconditions for a given level of deployment/operation of our tools and methods. 
    
    Satisfaction of social preconditions as required to proceed with adoption of given software
    tools and methods isn't something I've read about, I don't think. It's a way in which software 
    could both impose pressure to improve up a scale and help in carrying out that task.
