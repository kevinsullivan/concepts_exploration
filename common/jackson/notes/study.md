# Thoughts on a Study

Research question: When it comes down to it, we as designers need ways to communicate concept structures, in Jackson's conception, to both engineers and with users. A concept is an abstract mathematical and/or computational structure designed to serve a human purpose. Research question: what form of modularity is implicated in Jackson's analysis? Our answer: typeclasses that capture hierarchies, libraries, of abstract mathemtical structures. 

Research question: are concepts effective as boundary-spanning objects in system design? To make sense of this question, we needed to be sure that we ourselves understood what is meant by "concept." The first contribution of this work is an answer to this question: a concept is a typeclass with a purpose. (KS: I disagree, though it can be documented in this style.) To support this claim, we show that Jackson's study of the concept of trash  concept of trash on Mac computers seems to require and benefit enormously from the combination of ad hoc and parametric polymorpism afforded by this mechanism, along with the possibility concisely express the laws of these behaviors as proof-valued fields in the usual manner.

We hypothesize that, maybe especially because of their formality, these kinds of specifications can serve directly as boundary-spanning objects.

[Oh gosh do we really want to do a singleton user study?]

The results in this paper come both from our having tested this hypothesis with several colleagues as customers, and from the work that was needed to set up the experiment in the first place, involving clarification of the concept of the concept. (Not publishable, too anecdotal, self-interest is concern).

Proof scripts and terms belong to the verification layer, not necesarily or usually of value to the user, except to the extent that it can produce certificates of trustworthiness that the user can really trust.

Note to self: What users really need to learn to do with us is to engage in precise discussions of system behaviors; as a matter of practice, can we profitably engage users in design of precise behavior specifications? One interesting aspect: it cleanly separates discussion of the types of functionings to be produced from that of implementations that can vary in multiple dimensions.
